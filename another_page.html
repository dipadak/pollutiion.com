    <p>Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in soil, in high enough concentrations to pose a risk to human health and/or the ecosystem. In the case of contaminants which occur naturally in soil, even when their levels are not high enough to pose a risk, soil pollution is still said to occur if the levels of the contaminants in soil exceed the levels that should naturally be present.</p>
    <h2><u>Causes:</u></h2>
    <p>All soils, whether polluted or unpolluted, contain a variety of compounds (contaminants) which are naturally present. Such contaminants include metals, inorganic ions and salts (e.g. phosphates, carbonates, sulfates, nitrates), and many organic compounds (such as lipids, proteins, DNA, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, PAHs, alcohols, etc.). These compounds are mainly formed through soil microbial activity and decomposition of organisms (e.g., plants and animals). Additionally, various compounds get into the soil from the atmosphere, for instance with precipitation water, as well as by wind activity or other types of soil disturbances, and from surface water bodies and shallow groundwater flowing through the soil. When the amounts of soil contaminants exceed natural levels (what is naturally present in various soils), pollution is generated. There are two main causes through which soil pollution is generated: anthropogenic (man-made) causes and natural causes.</p>

    <h2><u>Soil Contaminants:</u></h2>
      <p> There is a large variety of pollutants that could poison the soil. Examples of the most common and problematic soil pollutants can be found below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead</li>
        <li>Mercury</li>
        <li>Copper</li>
        <li>Zinc</li>
        <li>Nickel</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><u>The effects of soil pollution:</u></h2>
       <p> Soil pollution affects plants, animals and humans alike. While anyone is susceptible to soil pollution, soil pollution effects may vary based on age, general health status and other factors, such as the type of pollutant or contaminant inhaled or ingested. However, children are usually more susceptible to exposure to contaminants, because they come in close contact with the soil by playing in the ground; combined with lower thresholds for disease, this triggers higher risks than for adults. Therefore, it is always important to test the soil before allowing your kids to play there, especially if you live in a highly industrialized area.</p>
